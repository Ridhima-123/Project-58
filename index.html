        <p> Toothless is a dragon from the movie and book "How To Train Your Dragon" by Cressida Cowell.
            He is called toothless because it look as if he has no teeth but when he eats they suddenly appear. He is owned by Hiccup Haddock, a young Viking boy who is fearless but shy at times. Toothless is also the only Nightfury found in history. He was discovered by Hiccup.</p>
